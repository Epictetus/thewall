# The Wall

Online demo: http://thewall.agilityjs.com

The Wall is an [Agility.js](http://agilityjs.com) example app.  It lets anyone write on a virtual wall, anonymously.

The entire browser-side code is under:

    public/app.js

Node.js is used for the backend, MongoDB for the data store, and the [Skeleton boilerplate](http://www.getskeleton.com/) to make things look pretty.

## Getting started

To start the server you'll need `node.js` and a MongoDB server. Run:

    cd thewall/
    npm install
    node server.js

That's all. Have fun!
