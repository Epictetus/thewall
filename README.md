# The Wall

The Wall is an [Agility.js](http://agilityjs.org) example app.  It lets you write on a virtual wall, anonymously.

The app is under `public/app.js`, and contains the entire code. The [Skeleton boilerplate](http://www.getskeleton.com/) is used to make things look pretty.

## Getting started

To start the server you'll need `node.js`. Run:

    cd thewall/
    npm install
    node server.js

That's all. Have fun!
